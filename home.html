 			<p class="p1">When I was 9 years old, I enjoyed coding in HTML for <em>MySpace</em>, if you can remember that! If you didn't change your background, music, etc, then what were you even doing on MySpace, amIRight? HTML was pretty natural to learn again, even with their new fun quirks. CSS has been a powerful tool in coding making development much simpler. You can code the entire page to the specifications you need and create separate CSS files within the HTML files. This creates a style or design for the webpage! It's really cool and if you haven't yet, you should check out <a href="https://www.codecademy.com" target="_blank">Codecademy</a>. Their platform is super interactive and creates a fun learning environment. I've had an easy time retaining the information!</p>
